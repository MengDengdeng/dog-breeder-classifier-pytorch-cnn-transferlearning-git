# Dog Breeder Classifier
This project built a **GPU enabled CNN using Transfer Learning technique** using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) to predict the content of pictures. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

## Install
---
<a id='step0'></a>
The project requires **Python** and the following libraries installed:
* [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/)
* [glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html)
* [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [tqdm](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/2.2.3/)
* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org)
* [PIL](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/2.2.1/)
* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org)
* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org)
It will also require a software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

## Code
---
* Template code is provided in the `dog_classification_TransferLearning.ipynb` notebook file.
